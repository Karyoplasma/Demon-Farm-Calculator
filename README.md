# Demon-Farm-Calculator
A small tool to calculate the required stack size for farming Demons with Inferno in HoMM3.

Should be straighforward to use. Has a small data set of the hitpoint values of the most commonly used sacrifices. To sacrifice random joiners, put it on OVERRIDE and state the creature's hit points in the HP text field. 

First Aid combo box is for HotA 1.7.2+, if you are not playing HotA, leave it on NONE. (todo: implement specialty)

Good luck.

If you want to compile yourself, the GUI uses MigLayout as a layout manager, so you'll have to include the .jar in the classpath. Main method is in DemonFarmCalculatorGUI.
